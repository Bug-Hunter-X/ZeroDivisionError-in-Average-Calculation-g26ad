This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Python: how to gracefully handle division by zero when calculating the average of a list of numbers. The `bug.py` file contains code that works correctly for non-empty lists but could throw an exception for empty lists.  `bugSolution.py` shows a corrected version, demonstrating the correct and robust way to calculate an average and handle edge cases such as empty lists. This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in production-ready code.
